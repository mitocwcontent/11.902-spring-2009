Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 1 session / week, 2 hours / session

Course Description
------------------

In analyzing fiscal issues, conventional public finance approaches focus mainly on taxation and public spending. Policymakers and practitioners rarely explore solutions by examining the fundamental problem: the failure of interested parties to act collectively to internalize the positive externalities generated by public goods. Public finance is merely one of many possible institutional arrangements for assigning the rights and responsibilities to public goods consumption. This system is currently under stress because of the financial crisis. The first part of the class will focus on collective action and its connection with local public finance. The second part will explore alternative institutional arrangements for mediating collective action problems associated with the provision of local public goods.

Course Objective
----------------

The objective of the seminar is to broaden the discussion of local public finance by incorporating collective action problems into the discourse. This inclusion aims at exploring alternative institutional arrangements for financing local public services in the face of severe economic downturn. Applications of emerging ideas to the provision of public health, education, and natural resource conservation will be discussed.

Course Requirements
-------------------

1\. **Leading class discussion**  
Each student will be responsible for leading at least two class discussions. Discussion sessions will be scheduled in the second week of the class.

2\. **A final paper (if taking the seminar for 9 credit units)**  
Students will write a final paper for the class if they decide to take the course for more than 6 credit units. It could either be a research paper or proposal. The project will be divided into two parts:

*   A class presentation of the project at the end of the semester
*   A final paper (or research proposal) that is due 10 days after Ses #12

Course Grading
--------------

1\. Students who take the class for 9 credit units will be graded according to the following weights:

| ACTIVITIES | PERCENTAGES |
| --- | --- |
| Presentation of assigned readings and class participation | 60% |
| Class presentation of final paper (or research proposal) | 20% |
| Final paper (or proposal) | 20% 

  
 

2\. Students who take the class for 6 credit units will be graded based on their presentations of assigned readings and class participation.
